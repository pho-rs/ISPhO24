# Science Festival. ISPHO.
Some of the problems at the Science Festival require numerical modeling. Therefore, we have prepared some programs in Python for you. You can download these programs from this repository, which will be updated during the festival.

Each problem will be published on the [pho.rs](https://pho.rs). The name of the problem in the pdf is hyperlinked, for instance [T1. Stability in Paul trap](https://pho.rs/p/4080)

# Python
To work with Python you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Don't forget to select "Add Python to PATH" during installation!

We use numpy, matplotlib, scipy and tqdm packages, so install them using these commands in the console:
```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install scipy
python -m pip install tqdm
```

To quickly open a console in Windows you can type ```cmd``` into the Windows File Explorer address bar (use Ctrl+L to focus the address bar) and press Enter to open the terminal. To run the Python program i.e. "test.py", use this command in the console:
```
python test.py
```

To edit the source code of Python files you can use any text editor and we recommend you to download VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
