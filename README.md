# ISPHO 2024.
Some of the problems at ISPhO require numerical modeling or interaction with STM32. Therefore, we have prepared some programs in Python for you. Each problem is also published on the [pho.rs](https://pho.rs).

# Python
To work with Python you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Don't forget to select "Add Python to PATH" during installation!

We use some packages, so to install them from online repositories run install.bat

To quickly open a console in Windows you can type ```cmd``` into the Windows File Explorer address bar (use Ctrl+L to focus the address bar) and press Enter to open the terminal. To run the Python program i.e. "test.py", use this command in the console:
```
python test.py
```

To edit the source code of Python files you can use any text editor and we recommend you to download VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
